# SLR-_flood_risk_graphics
A lightweight R notebook base for generating graphics explaining how moderate 
SLR can sharply increase flood frequency, based on data from Portland, Maine.

The graphics are generated based on data from the Portland, Maine NOAA tide gauge,
accessed and analyzed via the `SLRSIM` package produced by the 
Casco Bay Estuary Partnership.  More information on the package is
available [here](https://github.com/ccb60/SLRSIM.git).
